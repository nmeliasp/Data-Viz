# Data-Viz
Repo for Data Visualization Project

## Summary:
My visualization explores Baseball player Homeruns vs their Height. The data set contains 1157 players and includes data on their
handedness(right,left, or both), height(in inches), weight(in pounds), batting average, and home runs. 


## Design:
After exploring the data, I decided to convey a relationship about a player's height and how many homeruns they hit. Because I wanted to
convey a relationship in the data, I chose to use a bubble chart. I chose to encode the player handedness as an additional variable.
This encoding can be seen in the bubble color. 

Several Iterations have been made to incorporate feedback that was given. 

* Iteration 1 - Initial Sketch
    * Inital scatter plot created with Handedness encodings. 
  
* Iteration 2 - Responding to issue items 1-3
  * Chart Title and color Legend added to provide context for visual.
 
* Iteration 3 - Responding to to issue item 4
  * Added ability to filter chart on handedness to provide interactivity and animation. 
 
* Iteration 4 - Responding to issue items 5-9
  * X-axis information was not showing up well in Firefox. Added some styling to fix this issue. Added HR to y-axis to clarify what HR means in the data. Improved the description and directions how to interact with the color legend.
