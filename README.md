# Data-Viz
Repo for Data Visualization Project

## Summary:
My visualization explores Baseball player Homeruns vs their Height. The data set contains 1157 players and includes data on their
handedness(right,left, or both), height(in inches), weight(in pounds), batting average, and home runs. 


## Design:
--explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
After exploring the data, I decided to convey a relationship about a player's height and how many homeruns they hit. Because I wanted to
convey a relationship in the data, I chose to use a bubble chart. I chose to encode the player handedness as an additional variable.
This encoding can be seen in the bubble color. 

Several Iterations have been made to incorporate feedback that was given.
